In the **Shopping Game** study, I am using a gamified paradigm to assess how much memory children use when the choice is up to them. Children will have to select items off of a shelf based on what items are on their shopping list. Sometimes, children have to wait to see the list. I am interested in whether this waiting time will encourage children to use more of their internal memory. Check out the preregistration [here](https://osf.io/txhq6). Currently in review at Developmental Psychology!

In the **Sticker Machine** study, I am working with [Quinn Pham](https://www.quinnpham.pro/index.html) to investigate whether 5 to 7 year-olds have spontaneous episodic future thinking. In our modified spoon-task, children will have the opportunity to make a spontaneous action in order to achieve a future goal. Check out the preregistration [here](https://osf.io/jauq2). Currently collecting data for experiment 2!

​I am also working on a **new version of the Shopping Game** that will explore whether adults decide to either memorize items on a shopping list or sample from the list to avoid using internal memory. This version will also incorporate pupillometry to assess mental effort during the task. Check out the preregistration [here](https://osf.io/853gf), and check out the Vision Science Society 2025 abstract [here](https://www.visionsciences.org/presentation/?id=2705)! Currently planning experiment 2!

In addition to these projects, I collaborated with my advisors Zsuzsa Kaldy and Erik Blaser on a theoretical chapter to be published in Advances in Child Development and Behavior. Will link to it here when it's out!\

I am also finishing up a series of experiments investigating the effect of proactive interference in 1.5-3.5-year-old toddlers. Check out the preregistration [here](https://osf.io/wg3ua/overview).
