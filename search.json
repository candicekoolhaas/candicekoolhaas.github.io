    "text": "In the Shopping Game study, I am using a gamified paradigm to assess how much memory children use when the choice is up to them. Children will have to select items off of a shelf based on what items are on their shopping list. Sometimes, children have to wait to see the list. I am interested in whether this waiting time will encourage children to use more of their internal memory. Check out the preregistration here. Currently in review at Developmental Psychology!\nIn the Sticker Machine study, I am working with Quinn Pham to investigate whether 5 to 7 year-olds have spontaneous episodic future thinking. In our modified spoon-task, children will have the opportunity to make a spontaneous action in order to achieve a future goal. Check out the preregistration here. Currently collecting data for experiment 2!\n​I am also working on a new version of the Shopping Game that will explore whether adults decide to either memorize items on a shopping list or sample from the list to avoid using internal memory. This version will also incorporate pupillometry to assess mental effort during the task. Check out the preregistration here, and check out the Vision Science Society 2025 abstract here! Currently planning experiment 2!\nIn addition to these projects, I collaborated with my advisors Zsuzsa Kaldy and Erik Blaser on a theoretical chapter to be published in Advances in Child Development and Behavior. Will link to it here when it’s out!\n\nI am also finishing up a series of experiments investigating the effect of proactive interference in 1.5-3.5-year-old toddlers. Check out the preregistration here."

    "text": "Hi, thanks for visiting my website! I’m Candice Koolhaas, and I’m pursuing an academic researcher track in cognitive psychology because I believe that contributing to and sharing knowledge on working memory, attention, and cognitive effort helps us all understand how our bodies and minds operate. Also, I am just having a lot of fun doing research, acquiring new skills, and meeting new people who share my excitement, so please feel free to reach out!\nA bit of history: In the Fall of 2023, I began my studies in the Brain and Developmental Sciences PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I work with Dr. Zsuzsa Kaldy and Dr. Erik Blaser studying cognitive development from infancy to adults in the Early Minds Lab and am grateful to be funded by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship.\nAt Eastern Connecticut State University, I received my B.S. in psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience. I worked with Dr. Lyndsey Lanagan-Leitzel studying visual attention in lifeguards and with Dr. Alita Cousins studying human mating behavior using pupillometry."

    "text": "I host a weekly stats club at my university for graduate students and faculty to talk anything data or stats related! I am passionate about stats education and I think being excited about learning is empowering! Check out Stats Snack here!\nI also host a weekly in-person meeting with research assistants in my lab where I introduce them to data analysis using R. When I’m on top of things, I post the homeworks and other resources here!\nI am also interested in cognitive improvement - check out my blog!\nI have a super nerdy Youtube channel where I plan to make for-fun videos summarizing concepts in cognitive psychology that really interest me. So far I have one video… hopefully more to come!\n\n(And all of these funny brain doodles are hand drawn by me on MS paint!)"
