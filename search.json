    "text": "&lt;h2&gt;Shopping Game&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  In the &lt;strong&gt;Shopping Game&lt;/strong&gt; study, I am using a gamified paradigm to assess how much memory children use when the choice is up to them. Children will have to select items off of a shelf based on what items are on their shopping list. Sometimes, children have to wait to see the list. I am interested in whether this waiting time will encourage children to use more of their internal memory. Check out the preregistration &lt;a href=\"https://osf.io/txhq6\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;Sticker Machine&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  In the &lt;strong&gt;Sticker Machine&lt;/strong&gt; study, I am working with &lt;a href=\"https://www.quinnpham.pro/index.html\"&gt;Quinn Pham&lt;/a&gt; to investigate whether 5 to 7 year-olds have spontaneous episodic future thinking. In our modified spoon-task, children will have the opportunity to make a spontaneous action in order to achieve a future goal. Check out the preregistration &lt;a href=\"https://osf.io/jauq2\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h2&gt;New Shopping Game Version&lt;/h2&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\n  I am currently collecting data on a &lt;strong&gt;new version of the Shopping Game&lt;/strong&gt; that will explore whether adults decide to either memorize items on a shopping list or sample from the list to avoid using internal memory. This version will also incorporate pupillometry to assess mental effort during the task. Check out the preregistration &lt;a href=\"https://osf.io/853gf\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the Vision Science Society 2025 abstract &lt;a href=\"https://www.visionsciences.org/presentation/?id=2705\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!\n&lt;/p&gt;"

    "text": "In the Fall of 2023, I began my studies in the Brain and Developmental Sciences PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I work with Dr. Zsuzsa Kaldy and Dr. Erik Blaser studying cognitive development from infancy to adults in the Early Minds Lab and am grateful to be funded by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship.\nI am interested in cognitive effort and the environment’s role in cognition. I plan to use pupillometry in my research to investigate how the external world affects the strategies kids and adults use to solve problems. I am also interested in cognitive improvement - check out my blog!\nAt Eastern Connecticut State University, I received my B.S. in psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience. I worked with Dr. Lyndsey Lanagan-Leitzel studying visual attention in lifeguards and with Dr. Alita Cousins studying human mating behavior using pupillometry."
