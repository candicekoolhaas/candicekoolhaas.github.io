In the Fall of 2023, I began my studies in the [Brain and Developmental Sciences](https://www.umb.edu/academics/program-finder/developmental-brain-sciences-phd/) PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I work with [Dr. Zsuzsa Kaldy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=o9DNhRMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Erik Blaser](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=he2zZyIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) studying cognitive development from infancy to adults in the [Early Minds Lab](https://umassbostonbabylab.weebly.com/) and am grateful to be funded by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship.

I am interested in cognitive effort and how we use working memory in naturalistic settings. I use pupillometry and eye-tracking in my research to investigate when and why kids and adults decide to use memory versus rely on information in-the-world.

At Eastern Connecticut State University, I received my B.S. in psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience. I worked with [Dr. Lyndsey Lanagan-Leitzel](https://www.easternct.edu/faculty-directory/lanagan-leitzel.html) studying visual attention in lifeguards and with [Dr. Alita Cousins](https://www.easternct.edu/faculty-directory/cousins.html) studying human mating behavior using pupillometry.
