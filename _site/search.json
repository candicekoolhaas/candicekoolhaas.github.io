    "text": "## Candice Koolhaas\nIn the Fall of 2023, I began my studies in the Brain and Developmental Sciences PhD program at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. I work with Dr. Zsuzsa Kaldy and Dr. Erik Blaser studying cognitive development from infancy to adults in the Early Minds Lab and am grateful to be funded by the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (NDSEG) fellowship.\nI am interested in cognitive effort and the environment’s role in cognition. I plan to use pupillometry in my research to investigate how the external world affects the strategies kids and adults use to solve problems. I am also interested in cognitive improvement - check out my blog!\nAt Eastern Connecticut State University, I received my B.S. in psychology with a concentration in cognitive neuroscience. I worked with Dr. Lyndsey Lanagan-Leitzel studying visual attention in lifeguards and with Dr. Alita Cousins studying human mating behavior using pupillometry."
